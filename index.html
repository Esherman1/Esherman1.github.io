<H2>About me</H2>
<p>I am a 9th grade student at Gems World Academy in Chicago. I always like to fix things and that has lead me to some impressive feats, such as when I repaired my grandparents' mini-van.  I'm interested in technology and engineering, as well as other sciences.  Primarily I like gaming but I also play squash and tennis. Our family has 2 very sweet dogs, Fanny my French Bulldog, and Gustave my Wired haired Griffon.</p>
<H2>Hobbies</H2>
<p>I fully intend to continue to repair objects and machines whenever I can. But I also enjoy helping out others when they don't seem to know how to do something.</p>
